    <h4>Morning Gratitude Practice.</h4>
    <p>Each morning I write down things that I am grateful for. I have been doing this for the past few weeks and I find it super effective. In fact, it is scientifically proved that gratitude is very powerful emotion, even more powerful than love. So pick up a pen and start writing.</p>
